## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm skip and welcome to my corner of the github universe!

I'm a frontend developer living in Oakland, Ca. I've been in the technology field for over 20 years now, the first 10 as a web designer where I leveraged my schooling in print design  to design everything from advanced UIs to web banner advertisements to themes for blogs, social media sites, as well as wordpress and similar. As I designed sites, I was often charged with building them out and thusly developed a good foundation to build my engineering skills upon.

As a developer with a design background, I feel I possess a unique skill set that allows me to work as a liaison between the technical side of things, and the less technical side of the company, such as designers and product managers, as well as customer service.

I enjoy working closely with design/product teams to produce advanced, engaging UIs, as well as with backend teams to help implement quality APIs minimising unneeded data sent to client.
