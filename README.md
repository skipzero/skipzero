## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm skip and welcome to my corner of the github universe!

I'm a frontend developer living in Oakland, Ca. I've been in the technology field for over 20 years now, the first 10 as a web designer where I leveraged my schooling in print design  to design everything from advanced UIs to web banner advertisements to themes for blogs, social media sites, as well as wordpress and similar. As I designed sites, I was often charged with building them out and thusly developed a good foundation to build my engineering skills upon.

As a developer with a design background, I feel I possess a unique skill set that allows me to work as a liaison between the technical side of things, and the less technical side of the company, such as designers and product managers, as well as customer service.

I excel at collaborating with the design team to discuss finer points of UI and with backend teams to help design quality APIs minimising large chunks of unneeded data being returned when endpoint is called.

I'm looking for a new, full time role in the San Francisco/Oakland or nearby areas focusing on frontend or nodejs development using best practices to construct readable, maintainable code. I welcome opportunities to mentor junior developers and help guide others, surpassing the expectations and deadlines
